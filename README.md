# Global Peace Index (GPI)
 The Global Peace Index (GPI) is a way to measure peace between countries and regions. It uses a variety of factors, such as the level of violence, the number of weapons, and the quality of life. The GPI is a valuable tool to understand the state of peace in the world and track progress over time.

 The Global Peace Index (GPI) is a way to measure how peaceful different countries and regions are. It does this by looking at a variety of factors, such as the level of violence, the number of weapons, and the quality of life. The GPI is a valuable tool for understanding the state of peace in the world and for tracking progress over time.

 Here are some of the factors that are included in the GPI:
Level of violence: This includes the number of homicides, armed conflicts, and terrorist attacks.
Number of weapons: This includes the number of guns, tanks, and other weapons in a country.
Quality of life: This includes factors such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, and access to education.
The GPI is calculated by giving each country a score out of 100. A score of 100 means that the country is perfectly peaceful, while a score of 0 means that the country is completely war-torn. The GPI is updated every year, so you can see how the state of peace in the world is changing over time.

The GPI is a valuable tool for understanding the state of peace in the world. It can help us to identify countries that are at risk of conflict and to develop policies that can promote peace. The GPI is also a useful tool for tracking progress over time and for measuring the effectiveness of peacebuilding efforts.

The code is a Dash app that uses the peace_index.csv dataset to create a map and charts that show the safety of countries around the world. The app allows users to select a year from 2011 to 2021 to see how the safety of countries has changed over time.

The first part of the code imports the necessary libraries, including pandas, folium, plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects, dash, base64, and dash_bootstrap_components. It also defines the app layout, which includes a header, a dropdown menu, and two divs that will contain the map and charts.

The next part of the code reads the peace_index.csv dataset and filters it to only include the years 2011 to 2021. It then calculates the global average safety score for each year.

The next part of the code creates the map and charts. The map uses the folium library to create a choropleth map that shows the safety score of each country. The charts use the plotly libraries to create a bar chart of the 10 least safe countries in the selected year and a line chart of the global average safety score over time.

The final part of the code defines the callback function that updates the map and charts when the user selects a different year in the dropdown menu.

The code is well-organized and easy to follow. It uses a variety of libraries to create a visually appealing and informative app. The app is a valuable tool for understanding the safety of countries around the world.
